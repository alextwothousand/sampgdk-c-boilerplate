# sampgdk-c-boilerplate
SAMPGDK C Boilerplate plugin.

## Why though?
Why not?
No, but seriously. I've spent countless hours setting up SAMPGDK projects over and over again. This is one hell of a life saver for me.

## Is this usable?
Yep. More than usable. Feel free to use C++ instead of C as well.
